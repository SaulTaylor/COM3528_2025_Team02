Windows :
1. Install anaconda 
2. Install VS build tools (Make sure C++ development is ticked and MSVC v142 2019 is ticked)
3. Set up conda environment at python 3.9
4. Install pip through conda
5. Open the terminal
6. Switch to conda environment
7. Navigate to the project directory 
8. Run the pip install in the build tool directory (pip install the requirements file, then all the imported packages)
9. Now should be able to run the code from the vs code terminal in the app

How The Model Works :
Emotion Detection :
1. Change the file path to the desired pretrained model to be used.
2. Run the program.
3. Wait for the recording indicator.
4. Record your audio (5 second clip)
5. Emotion displayed

Training :
*NOTE* The model has currently been trained on ravdess (An English emotion database) and their is a model for emodb (A German emotion database)
*NOTE* The database is full of actors saying sentences in different emotions, therefor a larger more application relevant database would be more ideal.

1. Change the database to be downloaded in the code.
2. Change the name of the model file to be created to something unique (.plt file)
3. The handling of database data will also have to be changed so it can be extracted effectively.
4. Run the program
5. An output assessing the quality of the program will appear after training.
6. The new model file can now be used to predict emotions.
